# CrowdLearn

An application for helping educators and learners get together to create more learning possibilities for all.

## User Story

A user will be able to register and login. They can act as either a teacher or a student with their account.

A user can search or create a class topic. This can range from craft skills to STEM to whatever can be imagined, as long as it is specific enough for a teacher to build a curriculum around.
A topic may have many teachers who propose curricula, while students and teachers alike may post about the topic on the board. Posts will most likely have upvotes and downvotes to raise their standing within the post archive. Students can also find teachers and bring the topic to their attention.

Once a teacher submits curriculum/pre-requisites for the class along with their requirements for pay, the area they are willing to teach within, and their available times, students can subscribe to that course/class. They can offer how much they are willing to pay for the class/course for a specific teacher, and vote/post a location/time slot. Once the minimum rate has been met by an agreed number of voters on the same location/time, a confirmation of acceptance is sent out to the participating users.


Once a confirmation has been sent out, user will have 24 hours to responds. Non-responders are removed from the group, while if a teacher is a non-response, the class is closed and canceled. When a class is confirmed, any other confirmation requests for the same class will be closed and canceled and users will not be able to see them anymore.


When all confirmations have completed, the class shows up on the usersâ€™s pages. Students can then submit reviews on the teachers whose classes they have attended.
